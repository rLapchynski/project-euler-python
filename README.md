# Project Euler solutions in python

This is a collection of solutions to Project Euler problems. I solved problems up to 53 in Java, and I don't particularly want to redo those in python, so those solutions are currently in my eclipse workspace repository (I may move them to their own repository and clean up the code at some point).
